# NixOS Modules

This is a collection of modules, built like the NixOS repo that extends it with
either generic features that might be shared between systems or simplifications
of things that might otherwise lead to duplicate code.

All of these should be more or less ready to copy yourself.

Any modules that are just presets are used with `original.option.preset.name.enable = true;`
